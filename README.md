# Caeser-Cipher
This program defines two functions encrypt and decrypt to perform encryption and decryption using the Caesar cipher with a key. The main function provides a simple command-line interface for the user to input text, specify encryption/decryption, and provide the key.

Features:<br>
Encryption: Encrypt plaintext by shifting each letter by a specified key value.<br>
Decryption: Decrypt ciphertext by shifting each letter by the inverse of the specified key value.<br>

Usage: <br>
  Clone the repository or download the caesar_cipher.py file. <br>
  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script. <br>
  Run the script using Python 3: <br>

  python caesar_cipher.py <br>

  Follow the on-screen instructions to choose between encryption and decryption and provide the necessary input.<br>
