# Caeser-Cipher
This program defines two functions encrypt and decrypt to perform encryption and decryption using the Caesar cipher with a key. The main function provides a simple command-line interface for the user to input text, specify encryption/decryption, and provide the key.

Features:<br>
Encryption: Encrypt plaintext by shifting each letter by a specified key value.<br>
Decryption: Decrypt ciphertext by shifting each letter by the inverse of the specified key value.<br>

Usage: <br>
  Clone the repository or download the caesar_cipher.py file. <br>
  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script. <br>
  Run the script using Python 3: <br>

  python caesar_cipher.py <br>

  Follow the on-screen instructions to choose between encryption and decryption and provide the necessary input.<br>

Note: <br>
This script supports only English alphabet letters (A-Z and a-z). Other characters (such as punctuation, digits, and spaces) remain unchanged during encryption and decryption. <br>
The key value specifies the number of positions each letter should be shifted. Positive values shift letters to the right (forward in the alphabet), while negative values shift letters to the left (backward in the alphabet).<br>
